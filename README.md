# Lab Instructions
In this lab we will be practicing retrieving an object from our custom Linked List. 
We will be implementing the `get()` method which should allow us to retrieve an object by its index in the list. 
The list itself should not be modified in anyway by this operation. 
Be sure to account for invalid idices, which should throw `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.
